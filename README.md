To predict sales for the real estate market 

We predict the residential home sales price in a mid-western city as a function of various characteristics of the home and 
surrounding property. 522 sets of data along with 12 variables have been used initially to fit the model. Issue such as 
multicollinearity has been observed. Residual analysis has been applied to the reduced model and tried to follow the pattern 
to determine whether the transformation is needed or not. In this work, we also checked possible outliers, high leverage points, 
and influential points using diagonal elements of the hat matrix, COOKâ€™S D, DFFITS, DFBETAS and COVRATIO. On the base of these 
analyses, 169 observations (influential points) have been removed and finally, the reduced model was determined that revealed 
as the most satisfactory model.
